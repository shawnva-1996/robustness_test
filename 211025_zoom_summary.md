Shawn Dabi's meeting
https://tldv.io/app/meetings/68f7230d4dad8a0013a35e19/
Immediate Action Items
Goal: Prepare demonstration for Professor Stephen by Friday. 28:07
Shawn plans to start by processing 60 videos from current batch. 29:17
Shawn to create presentation slides summarizing work and meeting Professor Steven's requests. 30:10
Final presentation scheduled for Friday at 11am in Wendy's personal Zoom meeting room. 32:31

Viral Video Prediction Model Development
Project objective: Determine what makes a video go viral 00:51
Initial findings reveal creator's follower count and heart count are most important predictive features 02:09
After second iteration, Random Forest model achieved 0.43 score with 'follower video ratio' as key feature 03:09
Third iteration extracted video features like audio loudness, tempo, silence ratio, brightness, cuts per second 04:22
Seventh iteration involved extracting audio transcription and engineering features like speaking rate and keyword detection 06:47
Model suggests more successful accounts generate more successful videos 10:21

Professor Feedback and Research Guidance
Shawn discusses project iteration and schedules research progress review with professor this Friday 12:01
Two main professor comments: perform data-driven feature engineering and test approach on non-client videos 13:16
Shawn has addressed half of professor's previous comments, remaining work on data-driven feature engineering 18:20

Technical Methodology and Data Transformation
Wendy explains Principal Component Analysis as a data-driven method for interpreting data similarities. 20:36
Wendy offers her existing code for reference, suggesting Shawn can modify it for video embedding. 22:17
Shawn needs to transform videos into vectors to use in machine learning models. 25:50
Wendy recommends using Gemini to help adapt her text embedding code for videos. 26:24
