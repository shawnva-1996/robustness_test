7532818182160059666," which smart home systems to use. Here are my recommendations for three stage progresses setup depending on where you are currently in your smart home journey. For stage 1 is to go with something simple to start with. Option 1, Apple HomeKit. Option 2, Google Home. Option 3, Amazon Alexa. Move to stage 2. In-kit users, you will want to add a home bridge or hope to your setup. System Google Home users, you will want to move out all your configurations to either smart things or homey. Google Home will be just be left with your voice commands and any other devices that you just can't integrate. Alexa users, it will be something similar. Stage 3, you're going to remove whichever systems that you have added in stage 2 and replace that with home assistant. So you can even have a mixture of Google, Amazon and Apple devices if you want. You have easy user friendly dashboards for your family to access the smart home.

7547231694214974738," This training board ice-keyboard! Here are our DIY smart home setups that just make sense, including what we used configured with Apple HomeKit. First is our smart floor fan, one tap on the iPad controls and firehouse. We can instantly see which lights are on and the best part it only costs 150 for a lifetime subscription and we also use our iPad to run our dishwasher, washing machine and real-bop back. Another setup that we really like are the shortcut switches. Our goodbye buttons shut down everything and close us a curtains when we go out and our goodnight button turns off the lights and powers on the aircon and fans. Now this is probably our most useful setup yet. Using motion sensors to turn on certain light configurations and even our water heater. This is super useful when our hands are full. Oh when we forget to turn something on. The last setup that really makes sense for us is using adaptive lighting. It's something subtle but noticeable and it changes the mood of the house automatically throughout the day and don't worry it's a free feature in Apple HomeKit so you just gotta make sure that you've got the red accessories. Before we start to under DIY we will quote it close to $8,000 for less than what you see here. Configuring your smart home is definitely not as hard as it looks but it does take a little effort and patience.

7268383374119570721," You wanna create your smart room where you don't know where to start and maybe you've got a few smart objects where you don't feel like it's making your life easier. This playlist is for you. I'll tell you everything you need to know in order to create the coolest smart room. Here are 3 secret rules you should keep in mind. Rule number 1. If it's not an improvement, don't do it or make it better. If you buy smart bulbs in your house and you need your phone to turn them on, you're doing it wrong. Flipping your Google switch is faster than using your phone. Rule number 2. The perfect smart room doesn't need apps or voice assistance. I know it can be hard to picture since literally every smart brand in the market sends you a positive signal by telling you how convenient it is to use their app to turn on their lights. But remember that the most profound technologies are the ones that disappear. Rule number 3. Avoid clouds at all costs. Apart from the security flaws and dollar are vesting, clouds can be unreliable. We all remember when Nest went down leaving all their users with a lot of freezing temperature inside their own homes. If you build a smart room, make it your own. These general rules would prevent you from wasting time and money while creating the best smart room. But remember that, above all, making a smart room is fun. Now we can move on on what you need to buy and which software you should use. See you in part 2.",272,4.357577699455303,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've skeptical of the Samsung frame at first, but I really love the artwork feature, especially in the bedroom where TV can be intrusive. There's an artwork store where you can choose artwork, I like to pick something seasonal and then customize the matte size and color. I love my motorized shades, especially using the remote to open them up from bed in the morning. I typically keep it mounted on the wall, but there's an app too. Every single light in my bedroom is a hue light, which works with home automation, but more importantly, can all be controlled from one convenient light switch. And for lamps that won't take one of few bulbs like this picture light, you can just use a hue plug to integrate it into your system. I like having a quality three and one dock next to my bed, and I like this one I picked up on Amazon, which I'll have linked in my bio for you. It comes in a nice space black finish and has a good weight to it, plus an articulating mag safe mount. Apple TV may seem obvious, but I like having one in the bedroom so I can pick up my shows right where I left them in the living room.

7455762468644605217," These are my top 5 smart home tech essentials to enhance your living experience. At number 1 is the Apple TV 4K, this is a great addition to the Apple ecosystem with built in Siri, HomeKit, Control and even FaceTime, and the operating system is miles ahead of any other smart TVs out there, most importantly it won't break the bank, they start from just £149 and are a great gift for anyone. Next up is lighting, this can really help enhance the mood of any living room space, and give in ambience for when you're either watching TV or just chilling with family. I'm using these Nano Leaf RGB light strips behind the TV and cabinet, and I think it gives a nice floating effect to the TV but also acts as a good lighting source for the room. I've also got these shapes from Nano Leaf which definitely give the place of character, and are a major talking point for my living room. These lights are also HomeKit enabled so you can control them from your Apple devices. Third is something that I think isn't prioritized enough, and that's the air quality in your home. I'll always recommend an air purifier, this is the never change 5 by shock, and I love it because the filter's last up to 5 years, and all you have to do is vacuum these trays every few weeks. It also has a percentage gauge on top to show you the air quality of your home. Now staying on the topic of cleaning a powerful vacuum that's easy to use and has some cool tech is the Dyson V15 detect. It comes with a soft brush head specifically made for hard floors which also has a built in laser to show you where the dirt is, but be careful because it can become addictive. For me though, it's now become a must have. Last but not least in order to control my smart home, some sort of smart speaker is needed. I'm using a few HomePod minis which I've dotted around the house, and this just makes it easier to control scenes and lights just using my voice. So those are my top 5 smart home tech products that I think would make your place just that much better.",386,4.000829187396352,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Matter is a universal language for smart devices, so even if devices are from different brands, they can still talk to each other because they speak the same language.

It's just here in the home map, as you can see. I have a lot of stuff. Starting out here in the living room, I have this light right here that I can turn on and off from my phone, as well as this one too. I have an automation setup for both of these lights. At 8pm every day, these lights turn on automatically. They also turn off automatically at 10.30 at night. The lights under the TV stand are also smart, and you can change the colors if you want. What I love about this one too, is I have an automation setup to where it turns on automatically. They're on like 11 o'clock at night. So if we need to walk out here to go to our daughter's room, it's not like, page black where we can't see anything. It just acts like a little night light. My dead bowl is smart too, so I can just unlock it from anywhere in the world really. This one takes a little bit longer. This is especially handy when we leave the house. We can't remember if we lock the front door. Also, these lights in the living room are smart. And they're dimmable, so I can turn them really low or really bright. This is a game changer, a thermostat is smart. If I'm laying in our room and I want the whole house to be cold, I could turn it down. My wife would always leave the pantry light on, so I added a sensor in here. So every time the door opens, the light turns off. That also turns off when you close it. Look at that. It's like one of my favorite things I've done. This is how small the sensor is. I actually really like this next one. Put an NFC tag in our daughter's bathroom. So every time we go to brush her teeth, I could just tap my phone right here. And a place shiny teeth in me. And a beard on the... The night light in my daughter's room is smart. It's also dimmable, and it could change to any color. I can turn on and off my daughter's ceiling fan light and her feet can choose from 25, 50, 75, and 100%. Now I'm here in the primary bedroom. I can turn off this light, this light, and I get turned on the fan. Which is so nice, especially when you're laying in bed and you want the fan on, you're like, I don't want to have to get up and turn the fan on. Just off my range. We also have an Apple TV in here. If you don't have an Apple TV, you need one. It is so good. It's so fast. I just love it. I have two of them. I have lights here behind the TV and under the TV stand. Oh, behind the TV stand. I have a smart outlet plugged into this level lamp and I can turn it on and off from my phone. I also have another smart outlet plugged into this lamp right here. Everything I showed you has an automation that goes with it. I wish these lights were smart. I couldn't find like any battery operated like smart things. I don't think they even make this. So I forgot to show you this. My garage door isn't home-kid compatible but you can buy an attachment that makes it home-kid compatible. So I bought it. Now I can open up my garage from my phone. Anyways, I have other things that I didn't show you. That is mommy bunny. I have other things around the house that I haven't showed you but if you guys want another video on it, just let me know. If you take any medication or vitamins, if you haven't taken them today, you should take them and you should fix your posture because it's like really bad. Anyways, thank you so much for watching.

So you see that the computer turns on and now the lights are going to turn blue and red according to the wallpaper on my computer. If I stand up and go away from the computer, you will see that the computer turns off and the lights go back to normal. Now what happens if I want to play some music on my phone? So let's go and play some music. I would test it onto the room. Nice playing in the old room. And you will see you will hear that when I go in the bedroom, it's automatically casted on the smart speaker here. So what happens now if I want to go to sleep? I just put my sleep mode on.
